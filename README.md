What is UUNIGATE Gateway?
-----------------------------------------

### Overview
UUNIGATE offers a unique experience by intuitively bringing altcoins/blockchain technologies and their communities together in an almost native layer solution. This is apposed to the typical systems seen in use today which require many steps and convoluted processes to conduct what should be a simple data transfer. To solve this several blockchain technologies have banded together to natively integrate smart-contracts and other advanced functionality together across multiple networks and chains.

### NFT (Non-fungible Token)
The UUNIGATE platform offers extensive support for all current open source blockchain projects that use the "Fractal Multi-chain Platform" module in their codebase. This allows users of any listed project of the website to send, receive, create and manage your NFTs and other smart-contracts all from one place online rather than having to download or install any software on a computer. Geared for users on-the-go and more mobile based solutions this is NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR A SOFTWARE CLIENT of the respective blockchains. You should always store your data with each respective blockchain's software client.

### Current Usability and Integration
It is recommended to join our Discord server and interact with the UUNIGATE NFT-bot that we have available there which is directly synced from the UUNIGATE webserver. The reason for using Discord is that this allows for a secure and simple solution to account handling while the on-site account handling is still being finalized. By providing this solution the blockchain's integrated are already able to interact and create their own smart-contracts without the UUNIGATE website being fully completed (in terms of on-site account handling and more advanced functionalities.)

### Future Integrations
If you represent a blockchain community and would like to see what the Fractal Multi-chain Platform and UUNIGATE can do for you please contact us in our Discord or on Twitter @uunigate.
